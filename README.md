# HelpDesk / Ticketing system demo project
Nathan Cho

## About
This is a MERN Stack application - Mongo DB, Express, React, Node.js

Users are able to create new tickets and fill in details and information.
The ticket look-up system allows users to input their e-mail address to look up tickets with that e-mail.

## Admin Features
Using the login interface, users can log-in to an admin account and access a menu to logout and respond to tickets.

When responding to a ticket, an administrator is able to change the status of the ticket and write a response. Once response is submitted, browser console will construct a 'demo' e-mail to send to the user who submitted the ticket.

## Usage

### Ticket Creation
On the ticket creation page tickets can be made using the form provided. Remember the email that you use to create it if you wish to look it up.
Note: All tickets can be viewed as a list by Admin

### Ticket Lookup
Look-up uses email to view tickets associated.
Sample tickets have been generated for: 'john@gmail.com'
